# OS Virtual Lab

In this project, we have implemented various modules of Operating system from scratch. One can use this for understanding the concepts of OS and the algorithms more easily. One can experiment with the algorithms.



Various modules implemented here are:

1. Deadlock and concurrency
2. Disk scheduling algorithms
3. Page replacement algorithms
4. Process scheduling algorithms
